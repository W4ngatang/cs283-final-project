# cs283-final-project
These files were originally created by Alex Wang for a final project for CS283, Fall 2015, Harvard University.

The demos folder contains three executables:
- text.exe: random sticks stereogram
	controls: 
		- a, s: move forest up and down
		- d, f: move plane up and down
		- q, w: move plane backwards and forwards
		- e, r: move forest backwards and forwards

- test_crosses.exe: black cross stereogram
	controls:
		- a, s: shift horizontal bars left, right
		- d, f: scale horizontal bar of true cross
		- q, w: move crosses forwards / backwards
		- e, r: increase / decrease angle in pseudo-cross
	
- test_sun.exe:
	controls:
		- a, s: move stereograms backwards and forwards
		- d, f: resize red component
	
While the stereograms are designed for Oculus Rift, they can be run on most computers simply by running the files.
An explanation of the demos are in the writeup contained in this folder
