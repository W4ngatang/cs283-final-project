# cs283-final-project
These files were originally created by Alex Wang for a final project for CS283, Fall 2015, Harvard University.

The demos folder contains three executables with the specified controls:
- text.exe: random sticks stereograms: 
  - a, s: move forest up and down
  - d, f: move plane up and down
  - q, w: move plane backwards and forwards
  - e, r: move forest backwards and forwards

- test_crosses.exe: black cross stereogram
  - a, s: shift horizontal bars left, right
  - d, f: scale horizontal bar of true cross
  - q, w: move crosses forwards / backwards
  - e, r: increase / decrease angle in pseudo-cross
	
- test_sun.exe:
  - a, s: move stereograms backwards and forwards
  - d, f: resize red component
	
This project explores the recreation of stereograms on the Oculus Rift using Unity. We also extend these stereograms so that they can be adjusted via user input, thereby creating a flexible tool by which psychologists and vision researchers can more easily study the human visual system.  While the stereograms are designed for Oculus Rift, they can be run on most computers simply by running the executable files found in the demos folder. A more detailed explanation of the demos can be found in report.pdf.
